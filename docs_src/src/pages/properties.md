# Properties

Normal props can be passed directly to the player, e.g. `<Player playing />`
(see https://github.com/cookpete/react-player#props)

Callbacks (https://github.com/cookpete/react-player#callback-props) are nested in a `callback` prop,
e.g. `<Player callbacks={{ onProgress: () => console.log(progress)}} />`
